# Fake-Currency-Detection-using-Deep-Convolutional-Networks
One major issue till date in India is the circulation of fake currency. Detection of counterfeit notes is still a challenging task by mere visual observation. We plan to use Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition techniques primarily to identify counterfeit currencies through this venture. A move towards solving this issue is by having an application that can recognize counterfeit notes by using camera images. Deep Learning models have seen remarkable advances in Image Classification and can be useful in differentiating an authentic currency note from a counterfeit one.
